> Feather is a lightweight namespace for generic F# tools and libraries — utilities I build "on wings of F#".

These packages reflect one practical, well-tested way I solve common problems in F#. They are not the only way, nor always the "best" way — they are my way, evolved from years of use.

- Purpose: share small, dependable F# utilities and patterns.
- Philosophy: pragmatic, readable, and composable — prefer clarity over cleverness.
- Tagline: "On wings of F#" — tools to help your code take flight.

Contributions and feedback are welcome; treat these libraries as a starting point you can adapt to your projects.
